# JustCollapse.jl

JustCollapse.jl is a Julia package designed to simulate magmatic systems using the pseudo-transient Stokes code from [JustRelax.jl](https://github.com/PTsolvers/JustRelax.jl). This repository aims to provide a robust framework for modelling caldera collapse of large-scale magmatic systems, leveraging the capabilities of JustRelax.jl for accurate and efficient simulations.

## Features
- Integration with JustRelax.jl for pseudo-transient Stokes flow simulations.
- Parallel computing and MPI support for large-scale simulations.
- Customizable setups for various magmatic scenarios.

!!! info "Installation"
    To install JustCollapse.jl, you can use the Julia package manager:
    ```julia
    using Pkg
    Pkg.add("https://github.com/aelligp/JustCollapse.jl.git")
    ```
